## Project title
API Group Project for Digital Crafts

## Decription
This Project was our first Front-End Project. Our Goal was to create a website to allow users to look up information on thier favorite Animes and Games. This was a Project where we allow ourselves to play with alot of different things that CSS can do by aiming at a younger and diverse audiance with a very fun UI.

Our Love of Video Games and Anime gave us the motivation to choose the APIs to work with.
